Rewrite the body of the function using nested conditional expressions. """

One note: this function is not very efficient because it ends up computing
the same values over and over. You could make it more efficient by memoizing
(see Section 11.6). But you will find that itâ€™s harder to memoize if you write
it using conditional expressions. """
