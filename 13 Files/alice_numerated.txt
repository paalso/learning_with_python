  13 
  14                       Down the Rabbit-Hole
  15 
  16 
  17   Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
  18 on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had
  19 peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
  20 pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'
  21 thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'
  22 
  23   So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
  24 for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
  25 the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
  26 of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
  27 Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
  28 
  29   There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice
  30 think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
  31 itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought
  32 it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
  33 wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
  34 but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
  35 POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
  36 her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
  37 before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
  38 take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
  39 field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
  40 down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
  41 
  42   In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
  43 considering how in the world she was to get out again.
  44 
  45   The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
  46 and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a
  47 moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
  48 falling down a very deep well.
  49 
  50   Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she
  51 had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
  52 wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look
  53 down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to
  54 see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
  55 noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
  56 here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She
  57 took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was
  58 labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it
  59 was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
  60 somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
  61 fell past it.
  62 
  63   `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I
  64 shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll
  65 all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,
  66 even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely
  67 true.)
  68 
  69   Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I
  70 wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.
  71 `I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let
  72 me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,
  73 you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
  74 lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good
  75 opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to
  76 listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,
  77 that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
  78 or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,
  79 or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
  80 say.)
  81 
  82   Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right
  83 THROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the
  84 people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I
  85 think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this
  86 time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall
  87 have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
  88 Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried
  89 to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling
  90 through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what
  91 an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll
  92 never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'
  93 
  94   Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
  95 began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I
  96 should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember
  97 her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were
  98 down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but
  99 you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.
 100 But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get
 101 rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
 102 way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do
 103 bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either
 104 question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt
 105 that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she
 106 was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very
 107 earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a
 108 bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of
 109 sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
 110 
 111   Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
 112 moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her
 113 was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
 114 sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:
 115 away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it
 116 say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late
 117 it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the
 118 corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found
 119 herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps
 120 hanging from the roof.
 121 
 122   There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;
 123 and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
 124 other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
 125 wondering how she was ever to get out again.
 126 
 127   Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of
 128 solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
 129 and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the
 130 doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or
 131 the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of
 132 them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
 133 curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little
 134 door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key
 135 in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
 136 
 137   Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
 138 passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and
 139 looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
 140 How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about
 141 among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
 142 she could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if
 143 my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of
 144 very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish
 145 I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only
 146 know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things
 147 had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few
 148 things indeed were really impossible.
 149 
 150   There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she
 151 went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on
 152 it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like
 153 telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which
 154 certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck
 155 of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'
 156 beautifully printed on it in large letters.
 157 
 158   It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little
 159 Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look
 160 first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';
 161 for she had read several nice little histories about children who
 162 had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant
 163 things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules
 164 their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker
 165 will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
 166 finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had
 167 never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
 168 `poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or
 169 later.
 170 
 171   However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured
 172 to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort
 173 of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
 174 turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished
 175 it off.
 176 
 177      *       *       *       *       *       *       *
 178 
 179          *       *       *       *       *       *
 180 
 181      *       *       *       *       *       *       *
 182 
 183   `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up
 184 like a telescope.'
 185 
 186   And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and
 187 her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right
 188 size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.
 189 First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was
 190 going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about
 191 this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my
 192 going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be
 193 like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is
 194 like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
 195 ever having seen such a thing.
 196 
 197   After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided
 198 on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!
 199 when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the
 200 little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,
 201 she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it
 202 quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb
 203 up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
 204 and when she had tired herself out with trying,
 205 the poor little thing sat down and cried.
 206 
 207   `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to
 208 herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'
 209 She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very
 210 seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so
 211 severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered
 212 trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game
 213 of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious
 214 child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no
 215 use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,
 216 there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable
 217 person!'
 218 
 219   Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
 220 the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on
 221 which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.
 222 `Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,
 223 I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
 224 under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I
 225 don't care which happens!'
 226 
 227   She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which
 228 way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to
 229 feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to
 230 find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally
 231 happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the
 232 way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,
 233 that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
 234 common way.
 235 
 236   So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
 237 
 238      *       *       *       *       *       *       *
 239 
 240          *       *       *       *       *       *
 241 
 242      *       *       *       *       *       *       *
 243
