##7. A drunk pirate makes a random turn and then takes 100 steps forward,
##makes another random turn, takes another 100 steps, turns another random amount, etc.
##A social science student records the angle of each turn before the next 100 steps are taken.
##Her experimental data is [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86].
##(Positive angles are counter-clockwise.) Use a turtle to draw the path taken by our drunk friend.

##8. Enhance your program above to also tell us what the drunk pirateâ€™s heading is
##after he has finished stumbling around. (Assume he begins at heading 0).
